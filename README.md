# Java ðŸ›’
The concepts given below are not limited to the subject, they are just a selective part to 
do something realistic and understand how underlying principles work together,when it comes all in a project.  

In the meantime feel free to explore other topics such as enum type, date and time, regex(Regular Expressions), Math Function,etc.  

# Concept
    1. Conditional statement and iterative process
            if, switch
            for,while,do-while
    2. String
            Manipulation 
            Searching, formatting 
    3. Array
            Types of data representation(1 D, 2 D)
            Pass array through function 
            Searching, sorting
    4. Data Structures for building applications
            Array list
            Hash map 
            iterator vs for each 
            while loop, hasNext() method in real use cases   
    5. Object Oriented Design  
            Loosly couple 
            Open-Closed Principle 
# Tech Stack
            Java, VSCode editor/Eclipse 
# Command line Usage 
        cd directory 
        mkdir directory name 
        rmdir directory name 
        del file 
        dir [options] [/a] [/s]
        javac filename.java
        java filename 
        javac packagename/filename.java
        java  packagename.filename 
        type filename.java
